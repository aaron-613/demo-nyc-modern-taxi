This JavaScript Google Maps + MQTT Paho demo application will connect to a specified Solace broker, and subscribe to the streaming NYC Modern Taxi data feed.  It will render a map of New York City, and project various locations of taxi cabs throughout the city.  If you click on a taxi, it will show your Passenger and Driver information.

This app was mainly built as a demo/test tool to visualize the output of the Java GPS publisher application.
